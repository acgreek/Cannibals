# Cannibals

Apes, Monkeys, and Missionaries need to cross a river in a boat that seats two. The missionaries and Apes can row on their own, the monkeys can only be passengers. If there are more monkeys/apes than there are missionaries on either side of the river, the monkeys/apes will eat the missionaries.
